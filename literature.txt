The Power of the Druids/Caesar/Druides rebus divinis intersunt, sacrificia publica ac privata procurant, religiones interpretantur: ad hos magnus adulescentium numerus disciplinae causa concurrit, magnoque hi sunt apud eos honore. Nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt, et, si quod est admissum facinus, si caedes facta, si de hereditate, de finibus controversia est, idem decernunt, praemia poenasque constituunt. si quis aut privatus aut publicus eorum decreto non stetit, sacrificiis interdicunt. haec poena apud eos est gravissima. ei quibus ita interdictum est numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habentur; eis omnes decedunt, aditum sermonemque fugiunt, ne quid ex contagion incommode accipient; neque his petentibus ius redditur neque honos ullus datur. his autem omnibus Druidibus praeest unus, qui summam inter eos habet auctoritatem. hoc mortuo, aut si qui ex reliquis excellit dignitate succedit, aut si sunt multi pares, suffragio Druidum, nonnumquam etiam armis, de principatu contendunt. disciplina eorum in Britannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur, et nunc ei, qui diligentius eam rem cognoscere volunt, plerumque in Britanniam discendi causa proficiscuntur./The Druids are involved with divine affairs, they conduct public and private sacrifices, and interpret all religious matters. A large number of young men gather towards these men to learn, and they (The Druids) amoung them (the young men) are in high esteem. For they decide almost every controversy, whether public or private, and if a crime has been perpetrated, or a murder committed, or if there is a dispute about inheritance or boundaries, the Druids make a decision about it. They also 'decide' upon rewards and punishments. If any man, either in a public or private capacity, does not stand by their decision, they ban them from sacrifices. This punishment is the most serious amoungst these men. Those men, who have been banned, are held amoungst the number of impious and wicked men. Everyone shuns these men, and flees their companion lest they should catch something from the contact of evil. Justice is also not given to those seeking it and neither are any honours. One of the Druids presides over all of them, who has the highest authority amoung them. With his death, if there is one man who excels in dignity, he succeeds, or if there are many who are equal, then they contend in an elections of the Druids for the presidency, not never with weapons. It is thought that the disciplines of these men were discovered in Britain and brought across into Gaul and now, men, who want to discover more about this way of life, set out to Britain to learn it.
The Education of the Druids/Caesar/Druides a bello abesse solent neque tribute una cum reliquis pendunt militiae vacationem omniumque rerum immunitatem habent. tantis praemiis excitati et sua sponte multi in disciplinam convenient et a parentibus propinquisque mittuntur. magnum ibi numerum versuum ediscere discuntur; itaque nonnulli viginti annos in disciplina permanent. neque fas esse existimant hos versus litteris mandare, cum in reliquis fere rebus Graecis litteris utantur. id mihi duabus de causis instituisse videntur, quod neque in vulgum disciplinam efferi velint, neque eos, qui discunt, litteris confisos minus memoriae studere. in primis hoc volunt, persuadere, animas non perire, sed ab allis post mortem transire ad alios, atque hoc maxime homines ad virtutem excitari putant metu mortis neglecto. multa praeterea, de sideribus atque eorum motu, de mundi ac terrarium magnitudine, de rereum nature, de deorum immortalium vi ac potestate disputant et iuventuti tradunt./The Druids are accustomed to being away from war and withhold tributes with the rest. They have leave from military service and a dispensation in all matters. Having been excited by such benefits, many join on their own accord and many are sent by their parents and relatives. They are said to learn a great number of verses there; and so, some will remain in training for twenty years. They think that it is not correct to commit these verses to writing although in almost all other matters, they use Greek letters. These things seem to me to have been put in place for two reasons: because they do not want their study to be carried out in the public and neither do they want those, who learn, to study less with memory having relied on writing. They want to establish this amoungst their leading ideas, that souls do not perish but transfer from one body to another after death, and they think that with this very great idea, men are roused to honour, with the fear of death having been neglected. Meanwhile, they discuss and tell young men many things about the stars and their movements, about the extent of the universe and our world, about the nature of all things and about the strength and power of the immortal gods.
The Religion of the Druids/Caesar/natio omnis Gallorum est magnopere dedita religionibus, atque ob eam causam ei, qui sunt affecti gravioribus morbis quique in proeliis periculisque versantur, aut pro victimis homines immolant aut se immolaturos esse vovent administrisque ad ea sacrificia Druidibus utuntur, quod, nisi pro vita hominis reddatur hominis vita, non posse deorum immortalium numen placari arbitrantur: publiceque eiusdem generis habent instituta sacrificia. alii simulacra ingenti magnitudine habent, quorum membra viminibus contexta vivis hominibus complent; simulacris incensis homines flamma circumventi pereunt. supplicia eorum qui in furto, aut in latrocinio aut aliqua noxia sint comprehensi gratiora deis immortalibus esse arbitrantur; sed, cum copia eius generis defecit, etiam ad innocentium supplicia descendunt./The entire nation of the Gauls is greatly devoted to religious matters, and for that reason those who have been affected with rather serious illnesses and those who are engaged in battles and dangers either sacrifice or vow that they will sacrifice men as victims, and they use the Druids as assistants for those sacrifices, because, unless the life of a man is offered up in the place of the life of a man, they judge that the power of the immortal gods cannot be appeased, and they have established and hold sacrifices of the same sort in the name of the state. Others have figures of great size, whose bodies woven with branches they fill with living men; when the figures have been burned, the men, encircled by flames, die. The executions of those who have been caught in theft or robbery or some other offence are thought to be more pleasing to the immortal gods; but, when the supply of that sort runs out, they even descend to the executions of innocent men.
The Invasion of Mona/Tacitus/igitur Monam insulam, incolis validam et receptaculum perfugarum, adgredi parat, navesque fabricatur plano alveo adversus breve et incertum. sic pedites, equites vado secuti aut altiores inter undas adnantes equis tramisere. stabat pro litore diversa acies, densa armis virisque, intercursantibus feminis, quae in modum Furiarum veste ferali, crinibus disiectis faces praeferebant; Druidaeque circum, preces diras sublatis ad caelum manibus fundentes, novitate adspectus perculere militem, ut quasi haerentibus membris immobile corpus vulneribus praeberent. dein cohortationibus ducis et se ipsi stimulantes, ne muliebre et fanaticum agmen pavescerent, inferunt signa sternuntque obvios et igni suo involvunt. praesidium posthac impositum victis excisique luci saevis superstitionibus sacri: nam cruore captivo adolere aras et hominum fibris consulere deos fas habebant./He therefore prepared to attack the island of Mona, which had a powerful population, and was a refuge for fugitives. Thus, the infantry crossed, and the cavalry followed by fording, or, where the water was deep, swam by the side of their horses. On the shore stood the opposing army, with its dense array of armed warriors, and between the ranks dashed women; they, in funereal clothing like the Furies, carried burning brands, with their hair dishevelled. All around, the Druids, raising their hands to heaven, pouring forth dreadful imprecations, scared our soldiers by the unfamiliar sight, so that as if their limbs were paralysed, they stood motionless and exposed to wounds. Then, urged by the general's appeals and mutual encouragements not to quail before a troop of frenzied women, they bore the standards onwards, smote down all resistance, and wrapped the foe in the flames of their own brands. A force was next set on the conquered and their armies, devoted to inhuman superstitions, were destroyed. They deem it, indeed, a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives, and they consult their deities through human entrails.
Boudicca's Rebellion I/Tacitus/rex Icenorum Prasutagus, divitiis diu clarus, Caesarem heredem duasque filias scripserat, tali obsequio ratus et regnum et domum suam procul iniuria futuram esse, quod contra vertit, adeo ut regnum a centurionibus, domus a servi velut capta vastarentur, iam primum uxor eius Boudica verberata et filiae stupro violatae sunt: principes omnes Icenorum, quasi Romani totam regionem muneri accepissent, avitis bonis exuuntur, et propinqui regis inter servos habebantur. qua contumelia et metu graviorum permoti, quod in formam provinciae cesserant, rapiunt arma; commoti sunt ad rebellionem Trinobantes et qui alii, nondum servitio fracti, recipere libertatem occultis coniurationibus pepigerant. accerrium in verteranos odium; qui in coloniam Camulodunum nuper deducti pellebant domibus Trinobantes, exturbabant agris, captivos vel servos appellabant; militesque superbiam saevitiamque veteranorum incitabant similitudine vitae et spe eiusdem licentiate. Ad hoc, templum divo Claudio exstructum quasi arx aeternae dominationis aspiciebatur, electique sacerdotes specie religionis omnes fortunas suas effundebant. nec difficile videabutr delere coloniam nullis munimentis saeptam; quod ducibus nostris parum provisum erat, cum amoenitati prius quam usui consuluissent./The King of the Iceni tribe, Prasutagus, famous for his prosperity for a long time, wrote that Caesar and his two daughters would be his heirs, thinking that with such a great submission, injustice would be far from both his kingdom and his home. This turned against him, so much so that his kingdom was plundered by centurions and the house by slaves as if they were war spoils. At first, Boudica was beaten and the daughters were violated through rape: all the Iceni chiefs were deprived of their ancestral gods, as if the Romans had taken the whole region as a gift, and the relatives of the king were held amoungst the slaves. Having been moved by this humiliation and fear of worse things to come, because they had fallen into the form of a province, they took up arms; the Trinobantes were moved to rebellion and those, who had not yet been broken by slavery, pledged themselves to take back freedom through secret conspiracies.
Boudicca's Rebellion II/Tacitus/iam Suetonio errant quarta decima legio cum vexillaries vicensimae et e proximis auxiliaries, decem ferme milia armatorum: comnetendere et acie congredi parat. eligitque locum angustis faucibus et a tergo silvis clausum; sciebat enim nihil hostium esse nisi in fronte, et apertam esse planitiem sine menu insidiarum. igitur legionarii instructi sunt frequentes ordinibus, levi armature circumstante; equites conglobate pro cornibus adstiterunt. at Britannorum copiae passim per catervas et turmas exultabant, tanta multitude quanta non alias, et animo adeo feroci ut coniuges quoque testes victoriae secum traherent, plaustrisque imponerent quae ad extremam planitiem posuerant./Now, Suetonius had the fourteenth legion with detachments of the twentieth and auxillaries from neighbouring areas, about ten thousand armed men. He prepared to make haste and join battle. And he chose a place with narrow defiles and shut off from the rear by woods. For he knew that there was nothing of the enemy except in front of him and the plain was open without the fear of ambush. Therefore the legionaries were drawn up in close formation, with lightly armed troops stationed around; the massed cavalry stood by on the wings. But the forces of the Britons were rushing about wildly everywhere in groups of infantry and troops of cavalry, as great a crowd as at no other time and in such ferocious spirit that they brought with them their wives also as witnesses of their victory, and they put them in wagons which they had placed at the edge of the plain.
Boudicca's Rebellion III/Tacitus/ac primum legio gradu immota et angustiis loci defensa, postquam in appropinquantes hostes certo iactu tela exhauserat, tamquam cuneo, erupit. auxilliares quoque impetum faciunt; et equites protentis hastis perfringunt quod obvium et validum erat. ceteri terga praebuerunt, difficili effugio, quia circumiecta plaustra saepserant abitus. et milites ne feminis quidem parcebant, confixaque telis etiam iumenta corproum cumulum auxerant. eo die, milites laudem claram et parem antiquis victoriis pepererunt: quippe sunt qui paulo minus quam octoginta milia Britannorum cecidisse tradant, militum quadringentis ferme interfectis nec multo amplius vulnerates. Boudica vitam veneo finit./And first the legion, unmoved from its position and defended by the narrowness of the place, after it had used up its javelines on the approaching enemy with sure aim, charged as a wedge formation. The auxilliaries also made an attacka nd the cavalry, with spears at full stretch, broke through whatever was in the way and strong. The rest turned tail in a difficult escape, because the surrounding wagons had closed off the way out. And our soldiers spared not even the women, and pierced by the javelins even the baggage animals had increased the heap of bodies. On that day the soldiers won glory which was distinguished and equal to ancient victories. Indeed, there are those who report that little fewer than eighty thousand Britons died and that about four hundred of our soldiers were killed and not much more than four hundred were wounded. Boudica ended her life with poison.
