The Invasion of Mona/Tacitus/igitur Monam insulam, incolis validam et receptaculum perfugarum, adgredi parat, navesque fabricatur plano alveo adversus breve et incertum. sic pedites, equites vado secuti aut altiores inter undas adnantes equis tramisere. stabat pro litore diversa acies, densa armis virisque, intercursantibus feminis, [quae] in modum Furiarum veste ferali, crinibus disiectis faces praeferebant; Druidaeque circum, preces diras sublatis ad caelum manibus fundentes, novitate adspectus perculere militem, ut quasi haerentibus membris immobile corpus vulneribus praeberent. dein cohortationibus ducis et se ipsi stimulantes, ne muliebre et fanaticum agmen pavescerent, inferunt signa sternuntque obvios et igni suo involvunt. praesidium posthac impositum victis excisique luci saevis superstitionibus sacri: nam cruore captivo adolere aras et hominum fibris consulere deos fas habebant./He therefore prepared to attack the island of Mona, which had a powerful population, and was a refuge for fugitives. Thus, the infantry crossed, and the cavalry followed by fording, or, where the water was deep, swam by the side of their horses. On the shore stood the opposing army, with its dense array of armed warriors, and between the ranks dashed women; they, in funereal clothing like the Furies, carried burning brands, with their hair dishevelled. All around, the Druids, raising their hands to heaven, pouring forth dreadful imprecations, scared our soldiers by the unfamiliar sight, so that as if their limbs were paralysed, they stood motionless and exposed to wounds. Then, urged by the general's appeals and mutual encouragements not to quail before a troop of frenzied women, they bore the standards onwards, smote down all resistance, and wrapped the foe in the flames of their own brands. A force was next set on the conquered and their armies, devoted to inhuman superstitions, were destroyed. They deem it, indeed, a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives, and they consult their deities through human entrails.
Druids: Power/Caesar/Druides rebus divinis intersunt, sacrificia publica ac privata procurant, religiones interpretantur: ad hos magnus adulescentium numerus disciplinae causa concurrit, magnoque hi sunt apud eos honore. Nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt, et, si quod est admissum facinus, si caedes facta, si de hereditate, de finibus controversia est, idem decernunt, praemia poenasque constituunt. si quis aut privatus aut publicus eorum decreto non stetit, sacrificiis interdicunt. haec poena apud eos est gravissima. ei quibus ita interdictum est numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habentur; eis omnes decedunt, aditum sermonemque fugiunt, ne quid ex contagion incommode accipient; neque his petentibus ius redditur neque honos ullus datur. his autem omnibus Druidibus praeest unus, qui summam inter eos habet auctoritatem. hoc mortuo, aut si qui ex reliquis excellit dignitate succedit, aut si sunt multi pares, suffragio Druidum, nonnumquam etiam armis, de principatu contendunt. disciplina eorum in Britannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur, et nunc ei, qui diligentius eam rem cognoscere volunt, plerumque in Britanniam discendi causa proficiscuntur./The Druids are involved with divine affairs, they conduct public and private sacrifices, and interpret all religious matters. A large number of young men gather towards these men to learn, and they (The Druids) amoung them (the young men) are in high esteem. For they decide almost every controversy, whether public or private, and if a crime has been perpetrated, or a murder committed, or if there is a dispute about inheritance or boundaries, the Druids make a decision about it. They also 'decide' upon rewards and punishments. If any man, either in a public or private capacity, does not stand by their decision, they ban them from sacrifices. This punishment is the most serious amoungst these men. Those men, who have been banned, are held amoungst the number of impious and wicked men. Everyone shuns these men, and flees their companion lest they should catch something from the contact of evil. Justice is also not given to those seeking it and neither are any honours. One of the Druids presides over all of them, who has the highest authority amoung them. With his death, if there is one man who excels in dignity, he succeeds, or if there are many who are equal, then they contend in an elections of the Druids for the presidency, not never with weapons. It is thought that the disciplines of these men were discovered in Britain and brought across into Gaul and now, men, who want to discover more about this way of life, set out to Britain to learn it
